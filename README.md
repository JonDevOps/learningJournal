# learningJournal
1. You can start small by allocating 20-30 minutes a day learning to program until it feels normal and you add more time to your schedule

2. Write what you learned, how to apply it, and write what you are going to learn next

3. Take breaks and ask questions
4. Play a codin game daily for 15-30 mins
5. Better yet work on an idea and improve it daily
6. Teach what you learn. (Pick a concept you want to learn, pretend you are teaching it to a 6th grader, identify gaps in your explanation, go back to source material to understand it better,review and simplify it)
7. Concepts first, Syntax later. (Understand each language or technology have their own architecture, design patterns, and concepts(MVC in Laravel, asynchronous in JavaScript, concurrency in Erlang, etc) If you understand the concepts, even if you don't write code for weeks, you can come back in just a few days with the syntax.(*its a slow process and may take time before you feel the changes))


TIP
A goo programmer doesn't memorize. Instead they learn how to research.
